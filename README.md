### Hi!  I'm Derek (DLCHAMP)
A motivated and enthusiastic Python developer with a love for coding and technology. With over 2 years of experience, I've honed my skills and am constantly striving to learn and improve. Outside of coding, I enjoy playing video games, building PCs, and staying up-to-date with the latest hardware advancements.
